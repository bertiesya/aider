## Step 1: Download and Install VMPP
 
To download VMPP, go to the official website[^1^] and click on the "Download" button. You will be redirected to a page where you can choose your version of 3ds Max and V-Ray. Select "3ds Max 2016" and "V-Ray 3.x" from the drop-down menus and click on the "Download" button again. You will get a ZIP file containing the installer and the documentation.
 
Extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice and run the installer. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation. You will be asked to enter your serial number during the installation process. Make sure you enter it correctly and click on "Activate". The installer will copy the plugin files to your 3ds Max directory and create a shortcut on your desktop.
 
## Step 2: Launch VMPP
 
To launch VMPP, open 3ds Max 2016 and go to "Customize > Customize User Interface". In the "Toolbars" tab, select "Siger Studio" from the "Category" list and drag the "XS Material Presets Studio" button to a toolbar of your choice. Click on the button to open VMPP.
 
You will see a window with four tabs: "Material Browser", "Material Lab", "Settings", and "About". The "Material Browser" tab is where you can access and apply the material presets. The "Material Lab" tab is where you can test your materials in different lighting scenarios. The "Settings" tab is where you can adjust some options for VMPP. The "About" tab is where you can check your license information and contact support.
 
## Step 3: Use VMPP
 
To use VMPP, you need to load a material library first. A material library is a collection of material presets that are organized by categories and subcategories. VMPP comes with several pre-built libraries for different types of materials, such as metals, wood, glass, fabrics, etc. You can also create your own libraries and import or export them as XML files.
 
To load a material library, go to the "Material Browser" tab and click on the "Load Library" button at the top left corner. A dialog box will appear where you can browse for a library file (.xml) on your computer or select one from the list of recent libraries. Click on "Open" to load the library.
 
You will see a tree view of the library on the left side of the window, showing all the categories and subcategories of material presets. You can expand or collapse them by clicking on the "+" or "-" icons. On the right side of the window, you will see a grid view of the material presets in each category or subcategory. You can change the size of the thumbnails by using the slider at the bottom right corner.
