# Transport Phenomena Fundamentals by Joel L. Plawsky: A Review
 
Transport phenomena are the processes that describe the transfer of momentum, energy, mass, and charge in physical systems. They are essential for understanding and designing various engineering applications, such as heat exchangers, reactors, separation units, and fluid flow devices. In this article, we will review the book *Transport Phenomena Fundamentals* by Joel L. Plawsky, which is a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the subject.

## Overview of the Book
 
The book is divided into two parts: Part I covers the balance equation in the context of diffusive transport, and Part II introduces convective transport terms and boundary layer theory. The book adopts a unified approach based on a balance equation that accounts for the different transport phenomena in a consistent manner. Each chapter adds a term to the balance equation, highlighting its effects on the physical behavior of the system and the underlying mathematical description. The book also provides numerous worked examples, problems, and numerical solutions to illustrate the concepts and applications of transport phenomena.
 
### Part I: Diffusive Transport
 
Part I consists of seven chapters that deal with the fundamentals of diffusive transport of momentum, energy, mass, and charge. The chapters are:

- Chapter 1: Introduction
- Chapter 2: Momentum Transport
- Chapter 3: Energy Transport
- Chapter 4: Mass Transport
- Chapter 5: Charge Transport
- Chapter 6: Coupled Transport Processes
- Chapter 7: Dimensional Analysis and Scaling

In these chapters, the author familiarizes the reader with modeling and developing mathematical expressions based on the analysis of a control volume, the derivation of the governing differential equations, and the solution to those equations with appropriate boundary conditions. The author also discusses some important topics such as non-Newtonian fluids, thermal conductivity, diffusion coefficients, electrical conductivity, thermoelectric effects, multicomponent diffusion, and similarity solutions.
 
### Part II: Convective Transport
 
Part II consists of six chapters that extend the balance equation to include convective transport terms and introduce the concepts of boundary layer theory and radiative heat transfer. The chapters are:

- Chapter 8: Macroscopic Balances
- Chapter 9: Momentum Transfer with Friction Factor Correlations
- Chapter 10: Energy Transfer with Heat Transfer Coefficient Correlations
- Chapter 11: Mass Transfer with Mass Transfer Coefficient Correlations
- Chapter 12: Boundary Layer Theory
- Chapter 13: Radiative Heat Transfer

In these chapters, the author explains how to simplify the full microscopic equations governing the phenomena to develop engineering solutions and introduces macroscopic versions of the balance equations for use where the microscopic approach is either too difficult to solve or would yield much more information than is actually required. The author also discusses how to apply these equations to heat exchangers, continuous contactors, and chemical reactors. The book introduces the three fundamental transport coefficients: the friction factor, the heat transfer coefficient, and the mass transfer coefficient in the context of boundary layer theory. Laminar flow situations are treated first followed by a discussion of turbulence. The final chapter covers the basics of radiative heat transfer, including concepts such as blackbodies, graybodies, radiation shields, and enclosures.
 
## Evaluation of the Book
 
The book is well-written and organized, with clear explanations and illustrations. The book covers both theoretical and practical aspects of transport phenomena in a systematic and coherent way. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students as well as practicing engineers who want to learn or refresh their knowledge of transport phenomena. The book also provides online resources such as exercises that can be practiced using a wide range of software programs available for simulating engineering problems[^1^] [^2^]. The book is updated with recent developments and references in the field.
 
The book has some limitations as well. The book does not cover some advanced topics such as multiphase flow, porous media flow, microscale transport phenomena, or computational fluid dynamics. The book also does not provide detailed derivations of some important equations or proofs of some important theorems. The book
