- One tool, single 3D space.
- One click smart presets.
- Replica, a unique effect that replicates the particles in various ways.
- Countless particle effects.
- Emitters, particles, replica, forces, 3D models, text & mask, maps.
- Space deformers, sphere, box, 3D models, bend, twist, maps, black hole.
- Splines, animatable, both as paths and emitters.
- Containers, enclose particles in sphere, box or a 3D model.

Superluminal Stardust 1.2.1 is compatible with Adobe After Effects CC 2015 and later versions (Windows x64 only). You can download a free demo or purchase a license from [aescripts.com](https://aescripts.com/stardust/).

One of the most impressive features of Superluminal Stardust 1.2.1 is the Replica effect, which allows you to create complex animations and patterns with a single particle system. You can replicate the particles along various shapes, such as lines, circles, grids, spirals, and more. You can also control the replication parameters, such as scale, rotation, color, and opacity, with ease. Replica can help you create stunning effects such as trails, kaleidoscopes, grids, and organic forms.
 
Another feature that sets Superluminal Stardust 1.2.1 apart from other particle systems is the ability to use 3D models as emitters, particles, or deformers. You can import your own 3D models in OBJ format, or use one of the many models included in the 3D model library. You can also apply materials and textures to the models, and animate them with keyframes or expressions. You can use 3D models to create realistic or stylized effects, such as fire, smoke, water, explosions, and more.
 
Superluminal Stardust 1.2.1 also supports 3D physics and collisions, allowing you to simulate realistic interactions between the particles and other objects in the scene. You can apply forces such as gravity, wind, turbulence, attractors, and deflectors to influence the motion of the particles. You can also enable collisions between the particles and 3D models or layers, and adjust the bounce and friction parameters. Physics and collisions can add a lot of realism and dynamism to your effects.
