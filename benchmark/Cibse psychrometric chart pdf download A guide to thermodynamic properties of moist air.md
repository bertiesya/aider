The CIBSE Psychrometric Chart is a graphical tool that shows the thermodynamic properties of moist air at various conditions. It is useful for HVAC engineers and designers who need to calculate the heating, cooling, humidification and dehumidification processes of air conditioning systems.

In this article, we will explain what the CIBSE Psychrometric Chart is, how it is constructed, and how to use it for HVAC design.
  
## What is the CIBSE Psychrometric Chart?
 
The CIBSE Psychrometric Chart is based on the data contained in CIBSE Guide C: Reference Data, which provides tables and charts of thermophysical properties for fluids and materials commonly used in building services engineering. The chart is a graphical representation of the equations that describe the state and behavior of moist air.
 
The chart has two axes: the horizontal axis shows the dry bulb temperature (DBT), which is the temperature of air measured by a thermometer; and the vertical axis shows the moisture content (MC), which is the mass of water vapor per unit mass of dry air. The chart also has several curved lines that represent different properties and processes of moist air, such as:
 
- The saturation curve, which shows the MC at which air is saturated (100% relative humidity) at different DBTs. The area above this curve represents superheated steam, and the area below it represents unsaturated air.
- The wet bulb temperature (WBT) lines, which show the temperature of air measured by a thermometer covered with a wet cloth. The WBT is lower than the DBT because of the evaporative cooling effect of the wet cloth. The WBT lines are parallel to the saturation curve at low MCs, and converge to it at high MCs.
- The specific enthalpy (H) lines, which show the total energy per unit mass of moist air, including both sensible heat (related to DBT) and latent heat (related to MC). The H lines are sloped upward from left to right, indicating that moist air has higher energy than dry air at the same DBT.
- The specific volume (V) lines, which show the volume per unit mass of moist air. The V lines are sloped downward from left to right, indicating that moist air has lower density than dry air at the same DBT.
- The percentage saturation (S) lines, which show the ratio of the actual MC to the saturation MC at different DBTs. The S lines are horizontal at low DBTs, and curved upward at high DBTs.
- The dew point temperature (DPT) lines, which show the temperature at which air becomes saturated when cooled at constant MC. The DPT lines are vertical at low MCs, and curved to the left at high MCs.

By using these lines and curves, we can plot a point on the chart that represents the state of moist air at any given condition. This point is called a state point, and it can be located by knowing any two independent properties of moist air, such as DBT and WBT, or DBT and MC.

1. Determine the design conditions for the indoor and outdoor air, such as DBT, WBT, MC, H, V, S and DPT. These conditions can be obtained from climatic data, building codes, standards or client specifications.
2. Plot the state points for the indoor and outdoor air on the chart using any two independent properties.
3. Draw a line connecting the indoor and outdoor state points. This line represents the mixing process of outdoor air with return air from the indoor space. The slope of this line depends on the ratio of outdoor air to return air in the system.
4. Locate a point on this line that represents the mixed air condition. This point can be found by using a mass balance equation or a graphical method.
5. Draw a line from this point to a point on the saturation curve that represents the desired supply air condition. This line represents the cooling and 8cf37b1e13
