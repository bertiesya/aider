Mugen supports various modes of play, such as arcade, versus, team, survival and training. It also has a built-in screenpack system that lets you customize the interface, menus and stages of your game.

1. I started by downloading a basic Mugen engine from [Mugen Archive](https://mugenarchive.com), which is one of the largest and most reliable sources of Mugen content on the web. I chose the version 1.1 beta 1, which is the latest and most stable version of Mugen as of this writing.
2. I then downloaded a screenpack from [Mugen Free For All](https://mugenfreeforall.com), which is another great site for finding Mugen content. A screenpack is a set of files that changes the appearance and functionality of your game's interface. I chose the [Mugen 1.1 Screenpack 1000+ Slots](https://mugenfreeforall.com/topic/37171-mugen-11-screenpack-1000-slots/), which is a simple and elegant screenpack that can accommodate up to 1000 characters in your roster.
3. I then began searching for characters on various Mugen sites and forums, such as [Mugen Archive](https://mugenarchive.com), [Mugen Free For All](https://mugenfreeforall.com), [Mugen Guild](https://mugenguild.com), [Mugen Wiki](https://mugen.fandom.com) and more. I looked for characters that matched my criteria: they had to be well-made, balanced, compatible with Mugen 1.1 and not too overpowered or broken. I also looked for characters that represented different franchises, genres and media that I liked or was curious about.
4. I downloaded each character individually and tested them in my game. I checked if they worked properly, if they had any bugs or errors, if they had good animations and sounds, if they had complete movesets and AI, if they were fun and challenging to play with or against 8cf37b1e13
